The QueryOrthodb Repository contains scripts to run BUSCO on either assembled genome or gene peptide sequences in fasta format.
The query_orthodb.py script was used to query the OrthoDB api using OrthoDB ids the are producted by BUSCO analyses.
The input for the query_orthodb.py script is a text file containing OrthoDB ids; one id per line. For example,

101787at71240
101801at71240
102474at71240
102816at71240
104482at71240

The query_orthodb.py script will query the OrthoDB api and extract the OrthoDB_ID, Name, Tax_ID, Molecular_Function, Biological_Process and Cellular_Component.
